## Connect MXChip IoT Developer Kit with your computer

Use the Micro USB to Type A USB cable to connect MXChip IoT Developer Kit to your computer.

## Collect sensor data and send it to your IoT hub

In this section, you deploy and run a sample application on MXChip IoT Developer Kit. The sample application blinks the LED on MXChip IoT Developer Kit, and sends the temperature and humidity data collected from the sensor to your IoT hub.

### Get the sample application 

1. In the Visual Studio Code, press `F1` or `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open command palette, type `Arduino: Examples`.
1. In `Arduino Examples` tab, navigate to `Examples for MXChip AZ3166` > `AzureIoTHub` and click on `GetStarted`.

### Install the package for MXChip IoT Developer Kit in the Visual Studio Code:

1. In the Visual Studio Code, press `F1` or `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open command palette, type `Arduino: Boards Manager`.
1. In `Arduino Boards Manager`, search for `AZ3166`, then click `Install`.
1. In Status Bar at the bottom, click `<Select Borad Type>`, then select `MXCHIP AZ3166`.

### Install necessary libraries

1. In the Visual Studio Code, press `F1` or `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open command palette, type `Arduino: Libraries Manager`.
1. Search for the following library names one by one. For each of library that you find, click **Install**.
   * `ArduinoJson`

### Config Wifi

Most IoT projects are relying on Internet connectivity. Use AP (Access Point) Mode on DevKit to configure WiFi.

#### A. Enter AP Mode

Hold down button B, click Reset button, then release button B. The screen will display SSID of the DevKit as well as the configuration portal IP address:

![getting-started-wifi-ap](media/getting-started-wifi-ap.jpg)

#### B. Connect to DevKit AP

Use your computer or mobile phone to connect to DevKit AP (highlighted in the screenshot above), leave the password as empty.

#### C. Configure WiFi for DevKit

Open IP address on the screen in browser, select WiFi you want your DevKit connect to, then type the password. Click **'Connect'** to configure and connect to WiFi.

![getting-started-wifi-portal](media/getting-started-wifi-portal.png)

Once the connection is succeeded, the DevKit will reboot in a few seconds. After reboot, you can test the connection by clicking button A. The WiFi SSID and IP address will display on the screen.

![getting-started-wifi-ip](media/getting-started-wifi-ip.jpg)

**Note:** The IP address displays on the web page might not be identical to the actual IP address assigned and displayed on screen. This is normal as the WiFi is using DHCP to dynamically IP assignment.

### Configure device connection string to DevKit (Windows)

1. Download [Putty](http://www.putty.org/)

1. Open Putty, in `Connection type`, select `Serial`, in `Serial line`, enter your Serial Port name, in `Speed`, enter `115200`, then click `Open` button

   ![putty-config](media/putty-config.png)

1. Get into configuration mode: Hold down button A, then push and release the reset button.

1. In the prompt of the serial port with `#`, configure your connection string you get from previous step:
  ```bash
  set_az_iothub [your connection string]
  ```
  You will see the information once configuration is successful:
  ```bash
  INFO: Set Azure Iot hub connection string successfully.
  ```
  Now close the Putty.


### Deploy the sample application to MXChip IoT Developer Kit

1. In the Visual Studio Code, in Status Bar at the bottom, click `<Select Serial Port>`, and then click the serial port `STMicroelectronics` for MXChip IoT Developer Kit.
1. Press `F1` or `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open command palette, type `Arduino: Upload` to build and deploy the sample application to MXChip IoT Developer Kit.

### Verify the sample application is running successfully

If you see the following output from the serial monitor window and the blinking LED on MXChip IoT Developer Kit, the sample application is running successfully.
